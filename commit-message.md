# Git Commit for ChromaDB Vector Search Restoration

## Commit Message:
```
feat: restore ChromaDB vector search with bulk JSON reload functionality

- Add manual-reload.mjs script for bulk loading JSON memories into ChromaDB
- Fix missing reloadAllMemoriesFromJson method implementation in compiled code
- Successfully loaded 42 conversation memories with vector embeddings
- Restore semantic search functionality with 0.45-0.79 relevance scores
- Enable cross-session intelligence and technical context retrieval
- Verify ChromaDB persistence and embedding generation working correctly

Resolves: ChromaDB collection empty after restart issue
Tested: All 42 JSON memory files successfully vectorized
Performance: Real semantic search replacing 0.02 fallback scores
```

## Git Commands to Execute:

```bash
cd /Users/kevinbrown/MCP-files
